# FizzBuzz
##### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem statement
#### Description
A classic Data Structures an algorithms problem, you are given an input list of integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). 
You have to write a fizzbuzz function that takes in an input list and iterates over it. When your function receives a number 
that is a factor of 3 you should store 'Fizz' in the output list, if the number is a factor of 5 then you should store 'Buzz' in
the output list. Additionally, if the number is a factor of both 3 and 5, you must store 'FizzBuzz' in the output list. For all other
cases, you must store the numbers as they are. Return the output list from your function.

Good Luck!
